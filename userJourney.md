### User Journey

After purchasing future concert tickets, the concertgoer uses the app Venu to create a ConcertEvent for the upcoming concert date. The user attends the live concert and captures many photos and videos on their phone. By the end of the event, their camera roll contains many media items, often mixed with unrelated content which makes it difficult to locate and revisit the concert experience on demand after the concert. The user again opens Venu to organize their media. The ConcertEvent now has a corresponding MediaAlbum that collects all media from that concert in one place.

The user can choose to generate an AI Summary of the concerts they have attended/will attend along with being provided with artist reccomendations based on their past concert experiences. This helps the user track their concert experiences over time and relive memories in a meaningful, organized way. With Venu, the user’s concert memories are organized and easily accessible.
